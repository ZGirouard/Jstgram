Jstgram
Written by Zach Girouard and Dane Troia

This program was written by one of my classmates and I using Java and MySQL. Jstgram pulls data from a MySQL server containing username, password, post, and visibility information. It then uses this information to verify user login, and allows users to create posts and change who can view their posts. This program was written for CSCE 156 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

IMPORTANT INFO: In order for the program to work, the user must change the hostname, username, and password to their MySQL server information in Database.java. Additionally, the user much change their username in the Project2.sql file so the program will work.
